// ============================== Exercise 23 ================================================================
// You are given a list of students' names and their test scores. Design an algorithm that does the following:
// a. Calculates the average test scores,
// b. Determines and prints the names of all the students whose test scores are below the average test score.
// c. Determines the highest test score.
// d. Prints the names of all the students whose test scores are the same as the highest test score.
// (Each of the parts a, b, o, and d must be solved as a subproblem. 
// The main algorithm combines the solutions of the subproblems.)
