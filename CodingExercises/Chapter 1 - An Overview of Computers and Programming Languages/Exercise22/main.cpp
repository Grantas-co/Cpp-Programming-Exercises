// ============================== Exercise 22 =========================================================
// A student spends a majority of his weekend playing and watching sports, thereby tiring him out and 
// leading him to oversleep and often miss his Monday 8 AM math class. Suppose that the tuition per 
// semester is $25,000 and the average semester consists of 15 units. If the math class meets three 
// days a week, one hour each day for 15 weeks, and is a four-unit course, how much does each hour of
// math class cost the student? Design an algorithm that computes the cost of each math class.
